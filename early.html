                <p>General Sir Hubert De La Poer Gough was born in London in 1860 on August 12th. Born into a distinguished military family (the only family to contain three separate Victoria Cross winners)
                    much of his early life revolved around the military. He and his mother and siblings followed his father to India for the 2nd Afghan war. Owing to the death of two siblings due to scarlet
                    fever, both Hubert and Jonnie were sent to Eton in England. After leaving Eton he attended Sandhurst and was gazetted to the 16th Lancers, rising to the rank of Captain by age 24.</p>
                <p>With the 1899 outbreak of the Boer War Gough was sent to South Africa to take part in the campaign, where he would repeatedly distinguish himself, being mentioned in despatches on four occasions, 
                    escaping from capture by the Boers, and eventually being sent back to England due to injuries sustained in service. It was in South Africa that he would meet many of the men who would
                    later play such key roles in the coming Great War including Sir Douglas Haig, Winston Churchill, Horace Smith-Dorian and Edmund Allenby. On returning to England, he served in the 
                    peacetime army, continuing to cultivate a reputation for decisive action and aggressive manueveurs. In 1913, his career was almost ended by what would come to be known as the 'Curragh incident',
                    a period of uncertainty regarding a possible Irish rebellion and a looming civil conflict over the issue of home rule. Thankfully, he survived the incident politcally unscathed and by 1914 was 
                    ready to take command in what was to be the defining years of his career.</p>
