				<p>After his scapegoating and subsequent politcal rehabilitation in 1918/19, Gough was chosen to lead a mission to the Baltic states to oversee British involvement in the steadily worsening Russian civil war.
                    Unable to openly act, it was not long before he found himself a political liability once more and was dismissed from command yet again. He returned to England and was neither offered nor sought another military post.
                    After this upheaval he briefly tried his hand at farming, owning property in Surrey and Kenya but deciding it wasn't for him and letting both properties go. He took up several directorships, including
                    Siemens brothers, which he continued to hold until his 80's along with 9 other directorships. He also oversaw fundraising and management of King's College Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital in London.</p>

                <p>At the outbreak of the Second World War, Gough enlisted in the Home Guard and was soon in command of the Chelsea branch. When Winston Churchill was made aware he was promoted to Zone Commander, despite the age restriction
                    which was overlooked in his case. He resisted promotion in favour of being able to have a more hands on role. After the conflict he continued his charitable work and directorships, before his death in 1963
                    at the age of 93. In his later years he enjoyed both gardening and astronomy and wrote several volumes detailing his life and career.</p>
