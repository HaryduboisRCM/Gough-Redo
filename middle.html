                <p>At the outbreak of war in August 1914, Gough followed the 3rd Cavalry Brigade to France and would be present at the battle of Mons and the Marne during the opening stages of the war.
                    By April of 1915, trench warfare had become a reality for the Western Front and Gough soon found himself commanding an infantry division rather than his trusty cavalry. As a close ally of Haig
                    he would see himself promoted with some regularity, serving as a corps commander for the Battle of Loos. By the time the Battle of the Somme was to begin in July of 1916, an entirely 
                    new army, the 5th, had been created and placed under his command to act as a reserve force. Due in large part to his tactical innovation and aggression, the 5th army would soon find itself 
                    a simple reserve force no longer, taking a major role in operations in 1917, such as the Third Battle of Ypres, or 'Passchendaele' as it would later be known.</p>

                <p>Following the heavy casualties sustained during the Passchendaele operation, the 5th army was sent south in order to rest, resupply and prepare defensive positions south of the river Somme.
                    With the Russian exit from the war and a temporary advantage in numbers of troops available, the central powers committed to attack in early 1918 with the aim of using their superiority to deliver
                   a knockout blow and win the war decisively. This blow was to fall on Gough's exhausted 5th army, and in the days following the 21st of March, his forces were pushed back some 40 miles.
                   While this retreat undoubtedly saved the overall situation on the Western Front, it was not enough to save Gough. As a scapegoat for the retreat, he was dismissed from his post and recalled to England in disgrace.</p>
